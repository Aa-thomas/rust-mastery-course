# Weekly Reflection — Week 1                                                                   
                                                                                              
## What I Understood Deeply                                                                    
Ownership and borrowing make sense now, especially reference rules.                            
                                                                                                    
## What I Memorized but Don’t Own Yet                                                          
Lifetimes — I understand syntax but not intuition.                                             
                                                                                                     
## What Surprised Me                                                                           
How the compiler can detect logical aliasing errors without runtime cost.                      
    
## What I’ll Focus on Next
Write a small example exploring &str vs String and how lifetimes differ.
