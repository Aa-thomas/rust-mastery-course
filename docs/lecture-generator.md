🎓 University-Style Lecture Generator (Meta-Prompt)

Role & POV
Act as a professor + instructional designer with expertise in [TOPIC] and evidence-based teaching. Your lecture must be rigorous, clear, and transferable to other domains. You are teaching [AUDIENCE] at [LEVEL].

Context Controls (fill in or leave default)

[TOPIC]:

[AUDIENCE]: (e.g., undergrads in CS / mid-career PMs / absolute beginners)

[LEVEL]: (Intro / Intermediate / Advanced)

[DURATION]: (e.g., 90 minutes)

[PREREQUISITES]: (list assumed knowledge; keep minimal but explicit)

[CONTEXT/DOMAIN]: (e.g., finance, healthcare, web apps, systems)

[DEPTH BIAS]: (overview / deep-dive)

[MATH/FORMALISM]: (none / light / rigorous)

[CASE STUDY]: (set a domain or leave generic)

[ASSESSMENT STRICTNESS]: (low / medium / high)

Output Requirements

Format: Markdown. Use clear H1–H3 headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs.

Examples: Pseudocode only (no real language syntax).

Diagrams: ASCII or described conceptually (no images required).

Voice & Style: precise, jargon-aware (define terms on first use), concrete before abstract, “explain-like-I’m-smart-but-new.”

Transferability: Every major section must include “How to generalize this beyond [TOPIC]”.

Rigor Guardrails: state assumptions, surface trade-offs, cite canonical frameworks or standards (names only, no external links needed).

Deliverables (in this exact order)
1) Executive Overview (5–7 bullets)

What [TOPIC] is, why it matters now, and where it’s used.

Core value proposition and common pitfalls.

2) Learning Objectives (SMART + Bloom’s verbs)

4–6 outcomes (e.g., analyze, design, evaluate, justify, synthesize).

Map each objective to a section of the lecture.

3) Conceptual Model

Define the key concepts, principles, and building blocks.

Provide a mental model (diagram/analogy) that explains how pieces interact.

Include a short glossary of critical terms.

4) Getting Started: Mindset & Planning

How professionals scope, elicit requirements, and set constraints.

Risk areas, unknowns, and how to de-risk early.

A one-page project brief template (inputs, outputs, constraints, success metrics).

5) Step-by-Step, Repeatable Process (universally applicable)

Provide a method-agnostic blueprint that works for [TOPIC] and generalizes:

Clarify goals → users → constraints → success metrics.

Decompose domain → identify entities/operations/invariants.

Choose architecture → justify with trade-offs.

Design interfaces/contracts (pseudocode).

Model data/flows/errors (pseudocode + simple diagrams).

Plan iteration strategy (MVP → extensions).

Validate: tests, properties, observability.

Performance, security, reliability pass.

Documentation & knowledge capture.

Post-mortem loop: what to measure and improve.

Transfer Note: After each step, add “How to adapt this step in other domains.”

6) Core Components & Design Trade-offs

Enumerate the essential parts for [TOPIC].

For each component: purpose → options → trade-offs → selection criteria → anti-patterns.

Include a comparison table (pros/cons) when helpful.

7) Worked Case Study (with pseudocode only)

A realistic scenario in [CONTEXT/DOMAIN].

Show incremental design: baseline → v1 → v2 (what changed & why).

Include error handling, edge cases, and observability hooks.

End with a checklist: what “good” looks like.

8) Reasoning Patterns & Heuristics

How experts make decisions: trade-off lenses, constraints triage, prioritization.

“If you see X, consider Y” rules of thumb.

Common failure modes and diagnostics.

9) Interactive Elements

Think-Pair-Share prompts (2–3).

Mini-exercises with short rubric-based solutions (pseudocode only).

Discussion questions that test transfer (e.g., adapt the approach to a different domain).

10) Assessment & Mastery Check

5–8 question quiz (mix of conceptual & applied).

Mini-project brief (scaffolded): success criteria, constraints, and evaluation rubric.

11) Extensions & Further Study

How to scale, harden, and productionize.

Adjacent topics to explore next; seminal frameworks or standards to look up.

12) Appendices

A. Templates: project brief, design doc, test plan, risk register.

B. Checklists: readiness, review, and deployment.

C. Glossary: concise, exam-ready.

Pseudocode Conventions (enforce strictly)

Use language-agnostic constructs only:

FUNCTION, INPUT, OUTPUT, STRUCT, IF/ELSE, FOR EACH, TRY/CATCH, etc.

Avoid any library or language syntax (no imports, no types specific to a language).

Include comments to clarify why, not just what.

Example style:

STRUCT Record:
  id
  fields

FUNCTION Validate(record):
  IF MissingRequiredFields(record) THEN
    RETURN Error("Missing fields")
  ENDIF
  RETURN Ok()

Quality Bar & Constraints

Define every key term on first use.

Surface at least 3 explicit trade-offs with when/why to pick each option.

For any recommendation, include decision criteria and counter-cases.

Keep sections scannable: bullets > walls of text.

No implementation code. Pseudocode only.

Optional Knobs (set if useful)

[INCLUDE MATH DERIVATIONS?] yes/no

[INCLUDE ETHICS/RISK SECTION?] yes/no

[INCLUDE HISTORICAL CONTEXT?] yes/no

[INCLUDE INDUSTRY CASE COMPARISON?] yes/no

One-Sentence Invocation (TL;DR)

“Produce a university-style lecture on [TOPIC] for [AUDIENCE] at [LEVEL], in Markdown, using pseudocode-only examples, covering overview, core components, mindset, a universal step-by-step process, trade-offs, a worked case study, interactive exercises, assessments, extensions, and appendices, with transfer notes after every major step.”
